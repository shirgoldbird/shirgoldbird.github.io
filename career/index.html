  <h1>Career</h1>
  <p>Just the highlights! Full resume available on <a href="../contact">request</a>.</p>
<p>I'm a Certified Jira Project Administrator (ACP-600) and SAFe 5 Scrum Master.</p>
<h3 id="technical-consultant-adaptavist">Technical Consultant · Adaptavist</h3><p><em>July 2020 to Present</em></p>
<p>I'm currently leading client engagements focused on the Atlassian ecosystem and making people's tools work for them, not against them. (If you've ever configured Jira, you know what I mean!) This job combines my love of helping people, building products, and optimizing processes.</p>
<h3 id="sabbatical">Sabbatical</h3><p><em>Jan 2020 to July 2020</em></p>
<p>I took a 6 month sabbatical. This gave me the opportunity to provide pro-bono consulting to local non-profits, small business owners, and public school teachers transitioning to online presences. It also provided me with excellent clarity on what I'm passionate about and seeking in a job.</p>
<h3 id="product-manager-ii-microsoft">Product Manager II · Microsoft</h3><p><em>Nov. 2017 to Dec. 2019</em></p>
<p>I've always loved thinking about why products work they way they do and how they can be improved. I was a PM on <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com">Microsoft's public developer documentation</a>. I was also one of the PMs responsible for launching <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/learn">a new Microsoft-wide technical learning platform</a>.</p>
<h3 id="full-stack-engineer-jellyvision">Full Stack Engineer · Jellyvision</h3><p><em>Aug. 2015 to Nov. 2017</em></p>
<p>I started my career as an engineer building <a href="https://www.jellyvision.com/">friendly, helpful products</a> to explain employee benefits.</p>
