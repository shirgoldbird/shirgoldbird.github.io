                                was new to the idea of making extensions for existing platforms, I think this would have been a lot more useful. But as
                                someone who knows how to make extensions for applications, the information immediately presented to me was not useful as
                                it started too basic. I would much rather jump to the API docs immediately.<br /><br />

                                <i>Any other feedback or thoughts?</i> That first page I landed on had a lot of links but I wasn't sure where any of them would take me. It wasn't clear whether it would be documentation or examples or something else. But once I was in the actual documentation, it's way easier to navigate—maybe because I've had more experience with developer documentation pages like this and can understand how to navigate. I didn't understand how that other page was supposed to help me get here.

                                <i>On a scale of 1-5, how easy was it to find the information you were looking for?</i> <strong>5</strong>, docs go where I think they'll go, and I didn't have to use any kind of search to find a starter example. I just want the docs to quickly get me to a Hello World so I can move on from there. Other information is great but that's the goal.<br /><br />
                                
                                <i>On a scale of 1-5, how helpful did you think the content you found was?</i> <strong>4</strong>. Well written, solid pieces of information. Part of it is my own skimming, but I'd like more pictures and diagrams. It's a wall of text, and being able to absorb information in multiple formats is best. Explain things twice, have different methods to convey, to understand better.<br /><br />
                                
                                <i>On a scale of 1-5, how visually appealing did you find this website to be?</i> <strong>5</strong>. I like the color scheme, it's easy to read, and the fonts are nice.<br /><br />

                                <i>Any other feedback or thoughts?</i> There's a lot of blank space on the right side of the page. Maybe you could put a floating action button there or something.
