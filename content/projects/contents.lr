I've had the good fortune to work on some amazing projects over the course of my career. A few highlights include launching <a href="http://docs.microsoft.com/learn" target="_blank">the home for all technical learning at Microsoft</a>, building the frontend for a new financial planning tool for <a href="https://www.jellyvision.com/">Jellyvision</a>, and in my free time, running the world's largest <a href="https://www.npr.org/2019/08/14/750595032/the-friends-we-made-along-the-way-after-9-years-bronycon-calls-it-quits" target="_blank">My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic fan convention</a> (drawing 11,000 attendees).

I've compiled some of my public projects below. If what you see interests you, [get in touch](mailto:me@shirgoldbird.com).
