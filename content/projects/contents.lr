I'm just as passionate about what I do at work as I am about what I do outside of it. Below, you can find some of my favorite "extracurricular" projects.

## Tech Projects

### [Google Forms Storefront](https://github.com/shirgoldbird/google-to-paypal-invoicing)


A free, easy-to-use online storefront build on Google Forms, Google Apps Script, and the PayPal API. Built for independent artists making the transition to online sales for the first time. Used for processing $5k+ in sales.

### [Decidim Seattle](https://github.com/King-County-Equity-Now/decidim-seattle)

A proof-of-concept site for managing a participatory budgeting process for the City of Seattle. Built with the Decidim framework for the non-profit organization King County Equity Now.
