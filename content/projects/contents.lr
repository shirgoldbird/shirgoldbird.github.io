I'm just as passionate about what I do at work as I am about what I do outside of it. Below, you can find some of my favorite extracurricular projects.

## Tech Projects

### <a href="https://github.com/shirgoldbird/personal_budget" target="_blank">✨ Personal Budget</a>

A personal budgeting tool that connects to your bank accounts through the Teller API, gives you an easy-to-manage categorization UI, and then exports data to Google Sheets. Vibe coded with Claude (and actually works!).

### <a href="https://github.com/Rutter/bank-feeds-demo" target="_blank">✨ Rutter Bank Feeds Demo</a>

An interactive demo that guides users through the process of getting started with Rutter's Bank Feeds product. Used as an extremely customer success tool for a product I manage. Vibe coded with Claude (and actually works!).

### <a href="https://github.com/shirgoldbird/google-to-paypal-invoicing" target="_blank">Google Forms Storefront </a>

A free, easy-to-use online storefront built on Google Forms, Google Apps Script, and the PayPal API. Built for independent artists making the transition to online sales for the first time, and used for processing $5k+ in sales.

### Glitch Kibbitz

I play upright bass in <a href="https://glitchkibbitz.com/" target="_blank">Glitch Kibbitz</a>, a one-of-a-kind band that performs klezmer-style covers of classic video game tunes. I also designed and developed our website.
