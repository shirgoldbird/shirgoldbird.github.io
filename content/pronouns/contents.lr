title: Pronouns

body:

My pronouns are **they/them**. If you use **he/him**, that's okay too.

Here's a <a href="https://www.mypronouns.org/they-them" target="_blank">quick explainer</a> on what they/them pronouns are, and some <a href="https://pronoun.monster/they/them/them/their/themself" target="_blank">example sentences</a>.

Sometimes people use the wrong pronouns for me. If this happens, the way I prefer people handle it is to correct themselves and move on with the conversation. No need for an apology or further discussionâ€”sometimes mistakes happen.
