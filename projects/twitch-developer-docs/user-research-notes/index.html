    <h2 id="interview-1">Interview #1</h2><p><strong>Name:</strong> Jason
<strong>Age:</strong> 22
<strong>YOE:</strong> 6</p>
<p><strong>Background:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>DevOps engineer, makes sure code is production ready</li>
<li>Was a programmer for 3 years prior to this</li>
<li>Primarily a Java + PHP developer, currently works heavily with Python</li>
<li>Familiar with Twitch, occasionally watches streams</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Chatbot task:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Tried to find APIs</li>
<li>"None of their menus have dropdowns"</li>
<li>Thought he was looking for a Twitch extension</li>
<li>Gravitated towards "API" language but discarded it as unhelpful</li>
<li>Felt "Extensions" was closest to what he wanted</li>
<li>Ignored video content</li>
<li>Went to marketing site for extensions</li>
<li>Opened up documentation and design guidelines in a new tab</li>
<li>Hit a log-in screen, hit another disabled screen (down for maintanence)</li>
<li>Clicked through authorization screen</li>
<li>Found "Getting Started with Extensions" documentation page</li>
<li>Said he was overwhelmed by acronyms and information</li>
<li>"I don't even know if I'm looking for an extension anymore—none of these are chatbots"</li>
<li>Ctrl+f for "chatbot", found it in TOC</li>
<li>"I guess Extensions are totally useless"</li>
<li>Closed all tabs</li>
<li>Found Glitch but didn't know what it was</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Extension task:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>"Going back to extensions", clicked first link and got to Extensions layout</li>
<li>Normally would be looking for APIs—doesn't care about high level concepts, only interested in APIs</li>
<li>Confused by Developer Rig–"this isn't an SDK, it's like Xcode or something"</li>
<li>Compared it to Chromecast apps—specifying an endpoint and then embedding content into their UI</li>
<li>Was able to quickly orient after drawing that comparison</li>
<li>Went back to Dev Console to start actually building an extension</li>
<li>Found API documentation. "This is actually useful!"</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Ratings:</strong></p>
<p><em>On a scale of 1-5, how easy was it to find the information you were looking for?</em> <strong>2</strong>.</p>
<p><em>On a scale of 1-5, how helpful did you think the content you found was?</em> As a first time user, a <strong>3</strong>. If I was someone who was new to the idea of making extensions for existing platforms, I think this would have been a lot more useful. But as someone who knows how to make extensions for applications, the information immediately presented to me was not useful as it started too basic. I would much rather jump to the API docs immediately.</p>
<p><em>On a scale of 1-5, how visually appealing did you find this website to be?</em> <strong>3</strong>. Needs way more diagrams.</p>
<p><em>Any other feedback or thoughts?</em> Nope.</p>
<h2 id="interview-2">Interview #2</h2><p><strong>Name:</strong> Bish
<strong>Age:</strong> 24
<strong>YOE:</strong> 3</p>
<p><strong>Background:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Software engineer</li>
<li>Works primarily in systems-level languages (C, etc.)</li>
<li>Familiar with Twitch, enjoys watches speedruns and tournaments</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Chatbot task:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Looked for Twitch API</li>
<li>"Extension doesn't sound like what I'm looking for..maybe API?"</li>
<li>Felt the "Streams" API category was the most fitting, but still not perfect</li>
<li>Clicked on it and got to Twitch API reference</li>
<li>"This doesn't seem right…let's go back"</li>
<li>Returned to homepage, reread Extensions</li>
<li>Decided to click on Extensions</li>
<li>Landed on Extensions marketing page</li>
<li>"It asks a question (What types of extensions can I build?) and doesn't answer it!"</li>
<li>Clicked on "Create an extension" and landed on the Twitch login page, which lead to the developer consoler</li>
<li>Was about to enable 2FA when I stopped the task</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Extension task:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Clicked on first Extension link</li>
<li>Read content on the page</li>
<li>Found Hello World section</li>
<li>Assumed that there was a wizard available</li>
<li>Downloaded Developer Rig</li>
<li>Clicked on "Designing Extensions" docs</li>
<li>"There's a lot of reference stuff and design guidelines but I'm at the point where I'm worried about the high-level mechanics. Like how do I even get this thing going?"</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Ratings:</strong></p>
<p><em>On a scale of 1-5, how easy was it to find the information you were looking for?</em> <strong>4</strong>, because it wasn't a 5, but it also wasn't that bad. I don't know if I actually found what I wanted though.</p>
<p><em>On a scale of 1-5, how helpful did you think the content you found was?</em> I felt like the stuff on the [developer documentation] was a <strong>4</strong>. I felt that the content on the splash page you originally land on [main Twitch Dev homepage] is like a <strong>2</strong>.</p>
<p><em>On a scale of 1-5, how visually appealing did you find this website to be?</em> <strong>3</strong>.</p>
<p><em>Any other feedback or thoughts?</em> That first page I landed on had a lot of links but I wasn't sure where any of them would take me. It wasn't clear whether it would be documentation or examples or something else. But once I was in the actual documentation, it's way easier to navigate—maybe because I've had more experience with developer documentation pages like this and can understand how to navigate. I didn't understand how that other page was supposed to help me get here.</p>
<h2 id="interview-3">Interview #3</h2><p><strong>Name:</strong> Dare
<strong>Age:</strong> 24
<strong>YOE:</strong> 3</p>
<p><strong>Background:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Full-stack web developer</li>
<li>Works primarily in Python, lately moving to Kotlin and JS/HTML/CSS</li>
<li>Been a Twitch streamer, viewer, and stream engineer</li>
<li>As a stream engineer, hosted a channel using Xsplit with preset functions, hooked things up to StreamLabs</li>
<li>Never needed to use Twitch APIs, everything was done through StreamLabs which takes care of most of the API and behind-the-scenes work</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Chatbot task:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Scrolled to bottom of page, skimming for anything important</li>
<li>Clicked "View Sample Code" to see it on Glitch</li>
<li>Opened docs in a new tab</li>
<li>Moved over to docs while sample code loaded</li>
<li>Found chatbot info on docs landing page</li>
<li>Jumped past all introductory text to get to the "meat" of the page</li>
<li>Knew what Glitch was but didn't want to run a sample in the cloud</li>
<li>Looked at env variables first to figure out what was needed to build this project</li>
<li>Read the code for a Hello World chatbot</li>
<li>"I would just go copy this sample code to my clipboard, I wish there was a copy button"</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Extension task:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Noticed Extensions callout at top of page with image, "Extensions" header in TOC, and "Extensions" link further down the page</li>
<li>"I'll click the big image"</li>
<li>Jumped to what types of extensions he could build</li>
<li>Decided he didn't care about most of the content on the page—"this is important, but it's not my goal"</li>
<li>Gravitated towards "Hello World" example</li>
<li>"Since it's a download I won't do it immediately. If it was some bash commands I would do it right away. Downloads arebigger, I care about them more"</li>
<li>Read the "Hello World" example in depth without following it locally</li>
<li>"HTML, JS, and CSS…makes sense, it's probably running on Chromium or something"</li>
<li>"So it's just like React with a bunch of events…and the backend is maybe Node?"</li>
<li>"First things first is to learn what an Extension is. I want to know about all the extensions I can build, I'm looking for information gathering to generate ideas"</li>
<li>"So I would get the Hello World example together, write some CSS to test it out, and then set up a backend"</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Ratings:</strong></p>
<p><em>On a scale of 1-5, how easy was it to find the information you were looking for?</em> <strong>5</strong>, docs go where I think they'll go, and I didn't have to use any kind of search to find a starter example. I just want the docs to quickly get me to a Hello World so I can move on from there. Other information is great but that's the goal.</p>
<p><em>On a scale of 1-5, how helpful did you think the content you found was?</em> <strong>4</strong>. Well written, solid pieces of information. Part of it is my own skimming, but I'd like more pictures and diagrams. It's a wall of text, and being able to absorb information in multiple formats is best. Explain things twice, have different methods to convey, to understand better.</p>
<p><em>On a scale of 1-5, how visually appealing did you find this website to be?</em> <strong>5</strong>. I like the color scheme, it's easy to read, and the fonts are nice.</p>
<p><em>Any other feedback or thoughts?</em> There's a lot of blank space on the right side of the page. Maybe you could put a floating action button there or something.</p>
