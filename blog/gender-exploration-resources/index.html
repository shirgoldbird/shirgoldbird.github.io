    <p>Since coming out, I've had the great delight of talking to some folks about their gender journeys. Something that helped me a lot when I was first starting to explore my gender was taking in all the media I could find by trans and non-binary folks about their experiences. Their stories taught me new ways of relating to my body and the world, and gave me words for experiences I never could have described otherwise.</p>
<p>I've compiled a list here of gender-related media I found valuable and enjoyable. I'd <a href="../../contact">love to hear</a> what resonated with you and expand this list!</p>

<h2 id="books">Books</h2><p>I love reading books by trans/nonbinary authors. These books often aren't directly about gender but are still so illuminating, and it can be nice to step into a fictional world for a change.</p>

<p>Here's another <a href="https://www.haveyoureadnevada.club/trans-authors">list of books and other writing</a> by trans authors.</p>
<h2 id="youtubers">Youtubers</h2><p>Youtube has a sizeable trans/non-binary vlogging community. I prefer reading to videos and can’t make many recommendations, but have enjoyed watching Jackson Bird and Ash Hardell. Especially when I was at the start of transitioning, I found it really reassuring to see and hear another human talk about this stuff.</p>
<h2 id="wrap-up">Wrap-Up</h2><p>Overall, consuming media can be helpful, but finding a community (or more likely, multiple communities) where you feel comfortable talking with people is the most impactful way to parse gender stuff out. There are tons of Facebok groups, forums, and Slacks—most of which won't ask you for your real name or other identifying information. It can be really freeing to talk in a space where you’re anonymous, especially about sensitive topics like gender or sexuality.</p>
<p>Communities are a very individual thing so I won’t make specific recommendations, but there are lots of great ones out there. A Google or Facebook search can get you started.</p>
<p>Go forth and explore!</p>
