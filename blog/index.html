    <p><p>Since coming out, I've had the great delight of talking to some folks about their gender journeys. Something that helped me a lot when I was first starting to explore my gender was taking in all the media I could find by trans and non-binary folks about their experiences. Their stories taught me new ways of relating to my body and the world, and gave me words for experiences I never could have described otherwise.</p>
